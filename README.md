# Multi-Class Iris Species Classification with Logistic Regression
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying different species of Iris flowers using a custom logistic regression model. The project was completed as a course project in September 2023.

# Overview
The project implements logistic regression from scratch to classify Iris flowers into their respective species. It explores gradient descent and mini-batch techniques for model training, evaluates the impact of learning rate variations on accuracy, and extensively analyzes the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.

# Project Structure
**src/:** Contains the Python code for implementing logistic regression, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
**data/:** Includes the Iris dataset used for training and evaluation.
# Key Features
Custom logistic regression model development
Experimentation with gradient descent and mini-batch techniques
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize learning rate
Analysis of model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
Visualization of class probability curves and confusion matrices

# Credits
This project was completed as part of a machine learning course and utilized the Iris dataset available in the public domain.
